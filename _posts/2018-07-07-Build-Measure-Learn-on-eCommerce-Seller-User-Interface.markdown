## Challenges

Why this project is challenging? Well. It's impossible to design a product that meets the needs of our users if we don't know our users and the needs they have. So, my objective is to identify the primary seller's profile and achieve an optimal seller experience.


## User Stories

In the past few years, I was working with some eCommerce and FinTech startups. The problem I always met is lacking UX process in the developing cycle. Oftentimes, UX is being considered as a block or slows down the project. Why did that happen? I think the major reason is all about how to communicate and deploy a proper UX strategy into the organisation. And the most efficient way is to leverage persona into a design workshop and use it EVERYWHERE. Try to encourage the team to think, speak and sleep on a persona when we try to come up with user stories. For example, "Richard would like to use size conversion feature because he is selling shoes across different countries." Using "Richard to instead of "User." And I found it's easier to engage the team in the lengthy brainstorming session.


### Build-Measure-Learn And Think-Make-Check

I'd like to use this method by Eric Ries's to interpret how I play around with my team. After we understand what primary sellers profiles are, the next step is _BUILD_.


###### Conceptualize your idea by lo-fi wireframe ###### 

At this stage, we can just quickly use Sketch to wireframe and quickly communicate with PO or other stakeholders. Usually we always need to change back and forth several times till everyone is happy about that. Here's an example of a seller user interface.

###### Testing customers with high fidelity prototype ###### 

I know it has been always debated whether you'd test with lo-fi or hi-fi mockup with users. My suggestion is to use a high fidelity mockup. As matter of fact, users actually have more feedback if they feel they're using a real-life product. In the meantime, you are also educating them to adapt to a new feature.
I've been a big fan of Axure/CSS/Jquery when it comes to a high-fidelity prototype. It'd be reassuring that my testers would be well-received the prototype is exactly what I'm providing for. Recently, I start to try out Framer.Js, which is my fairly new tool for prototyping. It's really powerful on interaction and motion design, and you can easily get immediate results from preview.

This is a simple animation on mobile Seller User Interface that I've made it from Framer.

Then, _MEASURE_. Design validation is the most important part of my daily work. I always tell the team we shall test every feature as much as we could afford before handing over design documents to engineers. In an agile team framework, time is scarce and we try to keep everyone abreast of developing. By doing so, I bring the rapid evaluation and design process at each sprint or product iteration. We make wireframes and test them upfront in usability software or Google Analytics (you could check loop11 ), I feel it's quite a handy tool to integrate task-based scenarios into mockup.

Last step, _LEARNING_. By continuing to collect user feedback and analysing the user's path, we revise the design back and forth until the optimal usability goal is achieved.



### User Stories

Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar. I don't 'need' to drink. I can quit anytime I want! Soothe us with sweet lies. Bender?! You stole the atom. You don't know how to do any of those.

* Shinier than yours, meatbag.
* This is the worst part. The calm before the battle.
* Ooh, name it after me!

Say what? Throw her in the brig. Hey, you add a one and two zeros to that or we walk! You guys aren't Santa! You're not even robots. How dare you lie in front of Jesus? Ow, my spirit! Who's brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a death sphere?

Hey, you add a one and two zeros to that or we walk! You won't have time for sleeping, soldier, not with all the bed making you'll be doing. It's okay, Bender. I like cooking too. Hey, what kinda party is this? There's no booze and only one hooker.

Ummmâ€¦to eBay? But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop. I'm just glad my fat, ugly mama isn't alive to see this day. My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book 'Earth in the Balance'', and the much more popular ''Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth', we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards.

Your best is an idiot! Fry, you can't just sit here in the dark listening to classical music. And remember, don't do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to, in which case, for the love of God, don't not do it!

You, a bobsleder!? That I'd like to see! I'm Santa Claus! There's no part of that sentence I didn't like! Noooooo! I can explain. It's very valuable.

I'm Santa Claus! Is the Space Pope reptilian!? Who's brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a death sphere? I had more, but you go ahead.

It doesn't look so shiny to me. Kif might! You guys aren't Santa! You're not even robots. How dare you lie in front of Jesus? Oh, but you can. But you may have to metaphorically make a deal with the devil. And by "devil", I mean Robot Devil. And by "metaphorically", I mean get your coat.

Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here. Anyone who laughs is a communist! You're going to do his laundry? Michelle, I don't regret this, but I both rue and lament it.

Bender, we're trying our best. I daresay that Fry has discovered the smelliest object in the known universe! Oh, you're a dollar naughtier than most. Hi, I'm a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute.

You, a bobsleder!? That I'd like to see! No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires! Good news, everyone! There's a report on TV with some very bad news! When I was first asked to make a film about my nephew, Hubert Farnsworth, I thought "Why should I?" Then later, Leela made the film. But if I did make it, you can bet there would have been more topless women on motorcycles. Roll film!

Eeeee! Now say "nuclear wessels"! Why did you bring us here? Yeah, and if you were the pope they'd be all, "Straighten your pope hat." And "Put on your good vestments." That's the ONLY thing about being a slave.
