As ever, an exec. of startup has her/his own vision and planning for designing a e-commerce service how people will shop. In 2005 I was ~~shadowing~~ along a local seller how to post his domestic items to our Yahoo! audit platform while I was there as a researcher back then. In 2021, I'm ~~leading~~ to design a ~~cross-border e Commerce~~ service for a freight forwarding shipping startup as offering their customers to shop & ship at globe when some of brands will ~~not~~ ship to their regions/countries. This ever-changing eCommerce industry never ceases to surprise me, and there's always a LOT to learn! 


Each startup wants to ~~scale up~~ and generate more revenues. The foundation of our service is freight forwarding shipping, to ensure a ~~fluid~~ declaration & consolidation service, as it goes. But how to generate more services and revenues? Executives started to plan on shopping concierge, marketplace, cashback picks, coupons, one-click add to cart extension as we ~~forge~~ ahead. That does sound exciting,  and yet are we offering a fluid service experience? When a comprehensive ~~array~~ of services options have been offered, it also made customer experiences more time-consuming, ~~fragmented~~ and harder to navigate.

As the product roadmap is ~~evolving~~, design experts should heavily jump in and helping to ~~shape~~ the future of e Commerce ~~what~~ it should look like or ~~how~~ it will be as we're all suffering pandemic. However, I've only set up no more ~~5~~ key metrics until the result is progressing in this ~~startup,~~

* Deep diving in a **~~profile~~** of cross-border shopper. There're a lot of reason why they go overseas shopping, for instance, some stores ~~cannot~~ support the local credits
* Don't build ~~running-around~~ service. It ~~exhausts~~ your customers if they have gone at greater length only to look for coupons. 
* **~~Personalisation~~** becomes standard. Shoptagr (personal shopper) - AI engine using machine learning and predictive analytics that can simulate specific shopping behaviour, thus providing customers with the best match. 
* 70% **~~mobile~~** customers using our freight services that has a ~~proven~~ track record on the mobile revolutions. 
* ~~Go-to trend~~ will be ~~conversational~~ e-commerce (chat bots), machine learning, and universal charts
* As of now, lowering cart abandonment is ~~not~~ one of key metrics in this ~~freight~~ service,  but will be essential for shopping/marketplace as this service would evolve towards that direction. 
* ~~B2B~~ business is part of play. Covid has entirely shifted the lifestyle we used to know. Many retailer owners have to move their business online. **~~Shopping concierge~~** has offered the relations between shopper( requester) and buyer.
