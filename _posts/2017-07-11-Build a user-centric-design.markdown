I actually hate this title of being UX designer, it sounds the future of UX at my company only lies in my hands. Nobody else is going to make it happen. It only falls to me, which is not entirely true!! As matter of fact, I’m designer with no power and no authority and I believe that I don’t need those things to bring about change. I just need determination, perseverance and the willings to step out of my comfort zone.


## How it begins

In this project, I go beyond the edge of the screen and work as part of Customer Experience/Success department. On another day, my boss came over my desk, and he goes
_“we need to reform our webform design for a better customer experience.” “Roger!”_ Sounds easy! And I get started to sleep on it. _Hold a sec! Where should I begin?_


## A UX working flow

In fact, I took a couple of months to define this working flow in my organisation and this is not something that I will ever achieve alone. But I begin this process and in doing so adjust it consistently. I found it has ~~impacted~~ on my team and they somewhat started to understand what it means to be user-centric.

## Get on board with stackholders — Business goals


Of course, to build a user-centric flow in an organisation, we cannot continue to be the lone wolf. For that, we need to unite the stakeholders around common goals and causes. At the same time, we need to make sure business goals meet customer needs.

**The goal of this project aims at 3 aspects:**

* By encouraging customers to “Sign In” our system, our agent would easily get a clear seller profile from a registered email.
* By recommending articles from help centre, customers would have chance to find solutions on their own without reaching us. On the other hand, it’s helping to ~~reduce~~ the contact rate.
* Locate the user ~~path.~~ I think this benefits most of agents, because oftentimes, they need to ask customers back and forth at several rounds until they know what they’re exactly dealing with. It literally costs time and money as it slows the service down.


## Product design is not all about pixels

Interestingly, I quite often being asked _”can you do graphic design as well?”_ Most of time, UX role is considered to be ~~interchangeable~~ with the role of a UI designer. Yes! I design pixels as well, but I would go further. In UI stage, I provide an advanced visual presentation with a step-by-step screen flow. Besides, I also animate UI elements as I want to enable the team to think over the logic of interaction, layout, and transitions and get that view of life-like interaction of screens. This [article](https://aimo-mala.github.io/2018/07/07/Build-Measure-Learn-on-eCommerce-Seller-User-Interface/) illustrated in detail how to interact with stakeholders through a series of animated wireframes or UI.
