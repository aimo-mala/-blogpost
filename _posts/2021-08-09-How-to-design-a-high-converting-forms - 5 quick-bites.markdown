Almost every actions we wanted our customers to ~~complete~~ in our site, from sign up to declaration /consolidation, requires them to submit a form. As I can roughly witness from Hotjar, the declaration/consolidation form often takes up  2-5 minutes or longer of their time in order to complete it (depending how many parcels to be declared). 

In this ~~quick-bite guide,~~ I want to ~recap~ the best practices as I've done in past two(2) weeks, for improving the chance that a customer will easily complete the declaration/consolidation form to which that we apply to this process.

## quick-bite guide


####   a. Redefined the list of critical fields in the declaration form. 


A declaration form can be hassle in the logistic/eComm application if it's designed poorly. To **~~minimise~~** inputs(select/text), it will increase the time of completion. We removed the Courier field once a user has determined Warehouse field, as this is unnecessary option we don't want a user to respond it.


####  b. Revisited the flow 

The right list order can **~~increase~~** the rates of completion. Firstly, we combined the item category and sub category in to one flow. Secondly, a first-time customer will determine the item category as they wanted to declare before a long form appeared on the screen. Thirdly, we repositioned the order of credits redeem feature nearer Total pricing at the bottom of the form. 


####  c. Showed pre-populating fields with known data. 

The classic case we've done is ~~auto-fill~~ for item name & category with previous declaration history, In our site, category selection is most time-consuming. We show the recently-used categories with 2 or 3 shortcuts for selection, rather than just one. Not only it **~~quickens~~** the selection time, but also for the accuracy, as our customers are more likely to declare different category or item (name) each time. 

####  d. Showed the most likely answer is a default in fields where the data is unknown.

Our customers can choose either shipping or pickup features in our site, Ideally, I planned to build ~~Shipping profile~~ as a user has ability to set their primary delivery method, however the plan is foiled. We show the ~~last~~ delivery method as a user declared.

####  e. Optimisations. 

* Keep the text label concise & descriptive like I use Change to indicate the alternative delivery methods. 
* Show one-time off with the recently-used shortcuts like I designed for category/name, warehouse and redemption centre, because a user can still go back with standard steps when they're not responding to which you designed (don't pester)

They are some **~~basic~~** guidelines you could exercise in order to extract the most form performance possible and just think all the time you will save for your customers and business.
